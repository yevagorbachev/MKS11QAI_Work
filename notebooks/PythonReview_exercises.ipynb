At the end of each day when you've finished your household chores, he will pick a card, at random, from his pocket and show it to you, and then put it back into his pocket.

We call this whole process a \"trial\" and note the number of \"asks\" it took to see the whole set.  What we're interested in is the number of \"asks\" per \"trial\", but every trial is likely to be different, and so we'll do many, many trials and then average the number of \"asks\" per trial, and that will be our answer.\n",
